# Breakout(Python + Pygame-CE)
 - Breakout is a game inspired by Idle Breakout, where the goal is to break tiles by clicking them or purchasing balls that collide with the tiles. As you destroy more tiles, you earn money that can be spent on additional balls or upgrades. This game was made using **Python** and **Pygame Community Edition**.
 - This project is a completely custom game, and it taught me how to think through difficult problems and create working solutions. Specific skills I developed include working with classes, using dictionaries, and writing readable/well-organized code.
